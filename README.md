#### Installation
---
These are the steps taken to implement this project:
1. I created the bare bones of the three html pages: portfolio, about me, and contact.
1. Created the link to bootstrap and then implemented my custom css sheet.
1. Implemented a navbar with bootstrap and customized it to my specification.
1. I worked on the about me html page first.  Started the container and inputted my placeholder image and lorem text.
1. Installed a sticky footer.
1. Copied all the relevant skeleton html file from about.html to the other two files.  (including the navbar and sticky footer).
1. Made a container for the form from bootstrap and customized it, which completed contact html.
1. Made a container for the portfolio html and added enough rows and column for the six images being posted on the page.

#### Usage
---

The website is built upon three html pages. They are labeled contact, indexl, and portfolio. There is a navbar at the top for each of these pages. To properly navigate between these pages you need to just click on the link of where you want to go. The links will darken to specify which page you are currently on, and you can click my name in the top left to go to the index page.
